        <h2>Who is a web developer?</h2>
        <p>
          A web developer is at heart an interactive artist. They’re someone
          driven by a deep desire to create things. A web developer’s canvas is
          a user’s web browser. Much like how a curious child takes pleasure in
          making toys by joining LEGO blocks—and then experiences a similar joy
          in taking things apart to see how they’re made, a web developer’s job
          is to use the basic building blocks of the web (like HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript) to create something complex like a webpage. Don’t sweat
          it! We’ll get into all of those terms soon. It is also the web
          developer’s job to diagnose problems in a website’s functionality, to
          understand how something works by reading the code behind it, and to
          make changes to fix any issues. That essentially makes web developers
          the physicians of the world wide web. When we talk about the world
          wide web, we’re mainly referring to websites and web applications. At
          this point, the curious aspiring developer in you might be wondering,
          “What’s the difference between the two?” Well, we’re glad you asked! A
          website is usually a simple page or a group of pages (the popular web
          comic site, xkcd, for example). However, modern websites are much more
          than that. Take Google Docs, for example. It has a nice interface
          that, once opened, looks very much like a desktop software like
          Microsoft Office. Such complex websites are often termed web
          applications. A web developer today is expected to know how to create
          and work with web applications. Having said that, most people use the
          terms interchangeably, so don’t get too hung up on the terminology!

        <h2>Things which beginner should know</h2>
        <p>
          Writing a thousand lines of code and turning that into a website is
          one of the creative and complicated things for web developers. If you
          get excited seeing a lot of beautiful websites and thinking to try
          your hands on it then we need to open your eyes telling some important
          things that you should know as a web developer. Creating a website
          that gets a lot of users’ attention is not just about learning various
          programming languages, you also need to learn some other concepts like
          DevTools, data formats, testing, APIs, authentication and a lot of
          stuff like that once you will dig yourself into this field. We are
          going to cover some important stuff here that you should learn as a
          web developer.

        <h1 id="heading">HTML5</h1>
        <br />
        <h1>Html-5</h1>
        <h2>What is HTML5?</h2>
        <p>
          As the name suggests, HTML5 is the 5th version of HTML (Hypertext
          Markup Language). It is an upgraded version of HTML4.01. HTML5 comes
          with a variety of new and advanced features that make the life of
          developers more flexible.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML5 is the next major revision of the HTML standard superseding HTML
          4.01, XHTML 1.0, and XHTML 1.1. HTML5 is a standard for structuring
          and presenting content on the World Wide Web. HTML5 is a cooperation
          between the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext
          Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). The new standard
          incorporates features like video playback and drag-and-drop that have
          been previously dependent on third-party browser plug-ins such as
          Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, and Google Gears.
        </p>
        <h2>Browser Support</h2>
        <p>
          Browser Support The latest versions of Apple Safari, Google Chrome,
          Mozilla Firefox, and Opera all support many HTML5 features and
          Internet Explorer 9.0 will also have support for some HTML5
          functionality. The mobile web browsers that come pre-installed on
          iPhones, iPads, and Android phones all have excellent support for
          HTML5.
        </p>
        <h2>Backward Compatibility</h2>
        <p>
          HTML5 is designed, as much as possible, to be backward compatible with
          existing web browsers. Its new features have been built on existing
          features and allow you to provide fallback content for older browsers.
          It is suggested to detect support for individual HTML5 features using
          a few lines of JavaScript. If you are not familiar with any previous
          version of HTML, I would recommend that you go through our HTML
          Tutorial before exploring the features of HTML5.

              Create Stunning Web site - CSS handles the look and feel part of a
              web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the
              style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are
              sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used,
              layout designs ,variations in display for different devices and

              Learn other languages - Once you understands the basic of HTML and

          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
          describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
          such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
          XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
          alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2].
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
          including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
          content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
          specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
          pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
          .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
          content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page
          load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

        <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
          compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is
          most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
          non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB
          and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
          single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
          imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read
          more about JavaScript.

        <h3>JAVASCRIPT TUTORIAL</h3>
        <h2>Why to Learn Javascript?</h2>
        <h5>
          Javascript is a MUST for students and working professionals to become
          a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web
          Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of
          learning Javascript:
        </h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and
            that makes it a programmer’s great choice. Once you learnt
            Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as
            back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like
            jQuery, Node.JS etc.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web
            browser and so to learn Javascript you really do not need any
            special environment setup. For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox ,
            Safari and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast
            websites. You can develop your website with a console like look and
            feel and give your users the best Graphical User Experience.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop
            app development, and game development. This opens many opportunities
            for you as Javascript Programmer.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for
            those who know JavaScript. You can navigate over to different job
            sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in the job
